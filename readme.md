Getting and Working with Data

    working with positional data: This notebook shows how to
    plot positional data using matplotlib and some things you can 
    do with full positional data that you can't with event based data.    

    using Voronoi Diagrams: Applied to football, a Voronoi diagram will partition the pitch
    into zones that have a single player as the closest to each point in that zone.
    This notebook shows how you can, having positional data,
    calculate and plot Voronoi Diagrams.
